# Abstract
Spok is a personal, voice-first AI assistant designed to operate entirely offline, ensuring privacy and local control. The project integrates voice recognition, natural language processing, task automation, and AI-driven intelligence to create a robust assistant capable of managing reminders, messages, and information retrieval without relying on cloud services.

# Introduction

Modern AI assistants rely heavily on cloud computing, which raises privacy, latency, and data security concerns. Spok bridges this gap by providing a locally-run AI assistant that leverages large language models (LLMs), Python-based automation, and modular design. The project focuses on delivering a seamless user experience while maintaining full control

# Features
- Offline voice recognition and text-to-speech.
- LLM-based natural language understanding.
- Reminders and personal task management.
- Messaging through email or WhatsApp (optional API integration).
- Modular design for adding new skills.

# Technology Stack
- **Operating System:** Linux (CachyOS, Arch, or similar)
- **Programming Languages:** Python (main), C++ (optional for learning)
- **AI & ML:** LLMs, deep learning frameworks
- **Tools:** SysML for modeling, GitHub for version control, Linux IDEs (VSCode, PyCharm)
- **Hardware (optional):** PC, Raspberry Pi

# Methodology
- **Development Approach:** Agile, incremental, iterative.
- **Step-by-Step:** Voice I/O → LLM integration → Reminder system → Messaging → Additional skills.
- **Testing:** Unit testing, integration testing, and functional verification at each stage.

# Timeline
The project follows a 6-week roadmap with daily tasks and milestones.  
*Note: Timeline is subject to adjustment due to coding and project management challenges.*
