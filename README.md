Abstract

Spok is a personal, voice-first AI assistant designed to operate entirely offline, ensuring privacy and local control. The project integrates voice recognition, natural language processing, task automation, and AI-driven intelligence to create a robust assistant capable of managing reminders, messages, and information retrieval without relying on cloud services.

Introduction

Modern AI assistants rely heavily on cloud computing, which raises privacy, latency, and data security concerns. Spok bridges this gap by providing a locally-run AI assistant that leverages large language models (LLMs), Python-based automation, and modular design. The project focuses on delivering a seamless user experience while maintaining full control
